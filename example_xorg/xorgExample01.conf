# 1.0 Start from base file,  rip out wacom tablet stuff, I dont have one
#     Reorder sections, add dual head setup
#     >>> Gives 
#                Fatal server error:
#                Requested Entity already in use!
# 1.1 Reading further... TwinView mode on nv open source driver
# 1.2 After Feisty upgrade will not start on nVidia, change back to nv
#            until can get it running, then recheck with tools
#            and of course nv doesnt support Twinview?
# 1.3 Add more button support for Razor Copperhead
# 1.4 Envy for Fiesty with help from nvidia-xconfig
# 1.5 Enable dual head again
# 1.6 Change to 20" Viewsonic
# 1.7 Kernel update to 2.6.20 breaks nvidia again. 
#     Change to nv to get started
#     Run envy, then change back to unaltered xorg file
# 1.8 New nVidia 8600GT graphics card with dual DVI output
#     Required latest nVidia drivers 100.41.100
# 1.9 New Samsung SyncMaster 226BW 22" wide screen LCD
# 2.0 Hardy Heron 8.04 major upgrade. New envyng 1.1.1
#     New nvidia installer 173 version
# 2.1 Kernel update 2.6.24-18  Wont start after
#     Disabled two empty font paths, disabled type1 as it wasnt loading
#     Ran envy but boot crashes with Fatal server error Caught signal 4 server aborting libGLcore.so.1
#     Envy only reporting installer v169. It wont do 173 as thats beta
#     Yes, installed 173 manually. Seems 169 does not work on this system
#     Run NVIDIA(blah).run to setup
# 2.2 Add Asus Geforce 7200GS card in second PCI-E 16x slot
#     Needed help from nvidia-xconfig to get both to run
#     The screen IDs are not accumulative, that means, for each physical card, the screen ID starts with 0 again.
#     It treats the 7200 as 'primary' probably because it has a lower bus number
#         meaning you have to login to that screen.  Tool panel can be moved to any screen.
# 2.3 Attempting to get Compiz to run
#         Composite extension not found
#         You must use XOrg >= 6.8 for translucency and shadows to work
